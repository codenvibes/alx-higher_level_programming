- In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples

# Quiz questions
<details>
<summary>

### Question #0
</summary>

What do these lines print?
```py
>>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> b = a
>>> a[2] = 10
>>> b
```
- [ ] a
- [ ] b
- [ ] [1, 2, 3, 4]
- [x] [1, 2, 10, 4]
- [ ] [1]
</details>

### Question #1
</summary>

What do these lines print?
```py
>>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> a[1:3]
```
- [x] [2, 3]
- [ ] [1, 2]
- [ ] [1, 2, 3]

<details><summary>Explanation:</summary>

The index before the colon (`:`) is the start index (inclusive), and the index after the colon is the end index (exclusive). Therefore, `a[1:3]` will include elements at indices 1 and 2, but not the element at index 3.</details>
